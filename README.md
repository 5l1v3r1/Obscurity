# Obscurity
A URL and IP Address Obfuscation Toolkit to assist with Pentesting.'

Useful Link for Understanding URL Obfuscation - https://github.com/jesugmz/url-obfuscation

# Usage
A relatively self-explanatory system, input your URL (or IP address) and path and progress through the boxes in order. 


Note - for User:Pass injection domain names may be used to bypass some domain based filters, as well as for social engineering + phishing - e.g https://google.com@github.io

# Future
I intend to add additional character substitutions which work as well as cyrillic for the given purpose.
